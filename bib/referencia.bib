abstract = {A comparative study is made of the changes in the latitudinal structure of the F region electron density at fixed altitudes in the Indian equatorial region on days with and without postsunset onset of equatorial spread F, using (N-h) profile data of Ahmedabad (dip latitude 18.6°N), Waltair (dip latitude 10.6°N), and Kodaikanal (dip latitude 1.5°N). It is found that on spread F days the ratio of the electron density in the altitude region 270 - 300 km between Ahmedabad and Waltair showed a sudden enhancement starting at 1700 LT by a factor of 8 to 30 (at 1900 LT) from a near-constant value of about 2 during the daytime. No such enhancement of the density ratio was evidenced on days without spread F. The enhancement of the electron density ratio prior to the onset of spread F is interpreted as an intensification of the northern crest of the equatorial anomaly, with the ionization in the bottomside F region as far north as 9° from the dip equator participating in the crest intensification process. The rapid intensification of the ionization anomaly engenders a similar augmentation of the neutral anomaly around sunset hours. This in turn creates a localized cell of altitude dependent equatorward neutral wind that aids further intensification of the crests of both the anomalies and augmentation of ionization in the magnetic field line tube passing through the height of maximum plasma density of the F2 layer over the equator. The net result of these coupling processes is a weakening of the ambient transequatorial wind (particularly during northern winter months) and reduction of the north-south asymmetry of the ionization anomaly crests, a condition favorable for the onset of spread F (Maruyama and Matuura, 1984). The present study thus indicates a significant role of the anomaly intensification at altitudes much below the F region peak and associated neutral dynamics in the initiation of spread F.}

abstract={Ionospheric scintillation refers to amplitude and phase fluctuations in radio signals due to electron density irregularities associated to structures named ionospheric plasma bubbles. The phenomenon is more pronounced around the magnetic equator where, after sunset, plasma bubbles of varying sizes and density depletions are generated by plasma instability mechanisms. The bubble depletions are aligned along Earth's magnetic field lines, and they develop vertically upward over the magnetic equator so that their extremities extend in latitude to north and south of the dip equator. Over Brazil, developing bubbles can extend to the southern peak of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly, where high levels of ionospheric scintillation are common. Scintillation may seriously affect satellite navigation systems, such as the Global Navigation Satellite Systems. However, its effects may be mitigated by using a predictive model derived from a collection of extended databases on scintillation and its associated variables. This work proposes the use of a classification and regression decision tree to perform a study on the correlation between the occurrence of scintillation at the magnetic equator and that at the southern peak of the equatorial anomaly. Due to limited size of the original database, a novel resampling heuristic was applied to generate new training instances from the original ones in order to improve the accuracy of the decision tree. The correlation analysis presented in this work may serve as a starting point for the eventual development of a predictive model suitable for operational use.},

abstract={Electron density irregularity structures, often associated with ionospheric plasma bubbles, drive amplitude and phase fluctuations in radio signals that, in turn, create a phenomenon known as ionospheric scintillation. The phenomenon occurs frequently around the magnetic equator where plasma instability mechanisms generate postsunset plasma bubbles and density depletions. A previous correlation study suggested that scintillation at the magnetic equator may provide a forecast of subsequent scintillation at the equatorial ionization anomaly southern peak. In this work, it is proposed to predict the level of scintillation over São Luís (2.52°S, 44.3°W; dip latitude: ∼2.5°S) near the magnetic equator with lead time of hours but without specifying the moment at which the scintillation starts or ends. A collection of extended databases relating scintillation to ionospheric variables for São Luís is employed to perform the training of an artificial neural network with a new architecture. Two classes are considered, not strong (null/weak/moderate) and strong scintillation. An innovative scheme preprocesses the data taking into account similarities of the values of the variables for the same class. A formerly proposed resampling heuristic is employed to provide a balanced number of tuples of each class in the training set. Tests were performed showing that the proposed neural network is able to predict the level of scintillation over the station on the evening ahead of the data sample considered between 17:30 and 19:00 LT.},

abstract="Geospace phenomena such as the aurora, plasma motion, ionospheric currents and associated magnetic field disturbances are highly organized by Earth's main magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the charged particles that comprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but not across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena relative to Earth's magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate systems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the magnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common magnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are used, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of the Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most detailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic latitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These coordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are non-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such coordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done correctly.",

In order to cover the whole continent, four GNSS receiver networks, (Rede Brasileiro de Monitoramento Contínuo) RBMC/Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics, Low-latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network, International GNSS Service, and Red Argentina de Monitoreo Satelital Continuo, in total ~140 sites, have been used. TECMAPs with a time resolution of 10 min are produced in 12 h time delay. Spatial resolution of the map is rather low, varying between 50 and 500 km depending on the density of the observation points. Large day-to-day variabilities of the equatorial ionization anomaly have been observed. Spatial gradient of TEC from the anomaly trough (total electron content unit, 1 TECU = 1016 el m−2 (TECU) <10) to the crest region (TECU > 80) causes a large ionospheric range delay in the GNSS positioning system. Ionospheric plasma bubbles, their seeding and development, could be monitored. This plasma density (spatial and temporal) variability causes not only the GNSS-based positioning error but also radio wave scintillations. Monitoring of these phenomena by TEC mapping becomes an important issue for space weather concern for high-technology positioning system and telecommunication.}

abstract = "Precision agriculture has generated a very high profile in the agricultural industry over the last decade of the second millennium—but the fact of ‘within-field spatial variability’, has been known for centuries. With the advent of the satellite-based Global Positioning System, farmers gained the potential to take account of spatial variability. The topic has been ‘technology-driven’ and so many of the engineering developments are in place, with understanding of the biological processes on a localized scale lagging behind. Nonetheless, further technology development is required, particularly in the area of sensing and mapping systems to provide spatially related data on crop, soil and environmental factors. Precision agriculture is ‘information-intense’ and could not be realized without the enormous advances in networking and computer processing power. Precision agriculture, as a crop management concept, can meet much of the increasing environmental, economic, market and public pressures on arable agriculture. By the end of the new decade, most arable enterprises will have taken on the concept on a whole-farm basis."

abstract="Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.",

abstract = {The classic view is that Dst and SYM-H time series differ mainly due to the dissimilarity in the method to determine the base values. Dst and SYM-H are both indices designed to measure the intensity of the storm time ring current. They are calculated in similar but not identical manners. Since SYM-H has the distinct advantage of having 1-min time resolution compared to the 1-hour time resolution of Dst, it is worth determining if the differences introduced by using different ground stations and slightly different methods of baseline subtraction produce statistically significant differences in the values of the indices. We have examined data from these indices collected over more than 20 years to determine the extent to which Dst and SYM-H are equivalent or different. We found that a simple combination of linear trends with a break at SYM-H = −300 nT provides an excellent comparison with the Dst index. For quiet times and for small storms the deviations are typically no more than 10 nT. Moderate storms feature deviations typically only slightly more than 10 nT, and intense storms have deviations that are usually less than 20 nT. We conclude that the classic view is accurate and recommend that in future studies the SYM-H index be used as a de facto high-resolution Dst index.},

The associated storm/substorm relationship problem is also reviewed. Although the physics of this relationship does not seem to be fully understood at this time, basic and fairly well established mechanisms of this relationship are presented and discussed.

abstract = "The equatorial ionosphere and thermosphere constitute a coupled system, with its electro dynamical and plasma physical processes being responsible for a variety of ionospheric phenomena peculiar to the equatorial region. The most important of these phenomena are: the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) current system and its instabilities, the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA), and the plasma instabilities/irregularities of the night ionosphere (associated with the plasma bubble events – ESF). They constitute the major topics of investigations having both scientific and practical objectives. The tidal wind interaction with the geomagnetic field is responsible for the atmospheric dynamo electric fields, that together with the wind system, drives the major phenomena, under quiet conditions. Drastic modifications of these phenomena can occur due to magnetospheric forcing under solar-, interplanetary- and magnetospheric disturbances. They can also undergo significant modifications due to forcing by atmospheric waves (such as planetary- and atmospheric gravity waves) propagating upward or from extra tropics. This article will focus on the ambient conditions of the ionosphere–thermosphere system and the electro dynamics and plasma instability processes that govern the plasma irregularity generation. Major emphasis is given to problems related to the structuring of the equatorial night ionosphere through plasma bubble/ESF irregularity processes. Specific topics to be covered will include: equatorial electric fields, thermospheric winds, sunset electrodynamic processes, plasma drifts, EEJ plasma instability/irregularity generation, nighttime/post sunset plasma bubble irregularity generation, and very briefly, disturbance electric fields and winds and their effect on the ionization anomaly, the TEC and ESF/plasma bubble irregularities."

abstract = {We present the first global empirical model for the quiet time F region equatorial vertical drifts based on combined incoherent scatter radar observations at Jicamarca and Ion Drift Meter observations on board the Atmospheric Explorer E satellite. This analytical model, based on products of cubic-B splines and with nearly conservative electric fields, describes the diurnal and seasonal variations of the equatorial vertical drifts for a continuous range of all longitudes and solar flux values. Our results indicate that during solar minimum, the evening prereversal velocity enhancement exhibits only small longitudinal variations during equinox with amplitudes of about 15–20 m/s, is observed only in the American sector during December solstice with amplitudes of about 5–10 m/s, and is absent at all longitudes during June solstice. The solar minimum evening reversal times are fairly independent of longitude except during December solstice. During solar maximum, the evening upward vertical drifts and reversal times exhibit large longitudinal variations, particularly during the solstices. In this case, for a solar flux index of 180, the June solstice evening peak drifts maximize in the Pacific region with drift amplitudes of up to 35 m/s, whereas the December solstice velocities maximize in the American sector with comparable magnitudes. The equinoctial peak velocities vary between about 35 and 45 m/s. The morning reversal times and the daytime drifts exhibit only small variations with the phase of the solar cycle. The daytime drifts have largest amplitudes between about 0900 and 1100 LT with typical values of 25–30 m/s. We also show that our model results are in good agreement with other equatorial ground-based observations over India, Brazil, and Kwajalein.},

abstract = {Abstract As societal dependence on transionospheric radio signals grows, space weather impact on these signals becomes increasingly important yet our understanding of the effects remains inadequate. This challenge is particularly acute at high latitudes where the effects of space weather are most direct and no reliable predictive capability exists. We take advantage of a large volume of data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, increasingly sophisticated tools for data-driven discovery, and a machine learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) to develop a novel predictive model for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation. This work, to our knowledge, represents the first time an SVM model has been created to predict high-latitude phase scintillation. We use the true skill score to evaluate the SVM model and to establish a benchmark for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation prediction. The SVM model significantly outperforms persistence (i.e., current and future scintillation are identical), doubling the predictive skill according to the true skill score for a 1-hr lead time. For a 3-hr lead time, persistence is comparable to a random chance prediction, suggesting that the memory of the ionosphere in terms of high-latitude plasma irregularities is on the order of, or shorter than, a few hours. The SVM model predictive skill only slightly decreases between the 1- and 3-hr predictive tasks, pointing to the potential of this method. Our findings can serve as a foundation on which to evaluate future predictive models, a critical development toward the resolution of space weather impact on transionospheric radio signals.},

abstract = {Irregularly structured ionospheric regions may cause amplitude and phase fluctuations of radio signals. Such distortion is called ionospheric scintillation. These ionospheric irregularities occur as part of depleted plasma density regions that are generated at the magnetic equator after sunset by equatorial ionospheric plasma instability mechanism. Also known as ionospheric bubbles, they drift upward to high altitudes at the equator and extend/expand to low latitudes along the Earth magnetic field lines. Ionospheric irregularities affect the space weather since they present large variations with the solar cycle and during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. In general, navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System and telecommunications systems are also affected by the scintillation. The aim of this work is to apply data mining for the prediction of ionospheric scintillation. Data mining can be divided into two categories: descriptive or predictive. The first one describes a data set in a concise and summarized way, while the second one, used in this work, analyzes the data to build a model and tries to predict the behavior of a new data set. In this study we employed data series of ionospheric scintillation and other parameters such as the level of solar activity, vertical drift velocity of the plasma at the magnetic equator, and magnetic activity. The results show that prediction of the ionospheric scintillation occurrence during the analyzed period was possible regardless of the high variability of the ionospheric parameters that affect the generation of such irregularities.},

abstract = "Ionospheric Scintillations are rapid variations on the phase and/or amplitude of a radio signal as it passes through ionospheric plasma irregularities. The ionosphere is a specific layer of the Earth's atmosphere located approximately between 50km and 1000km above the Earth's surface. As Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) – such as GPS, Galileo, BDS and GLONASS – use radio signals, these variations degrade their positioning service quality. Due to its location, Brazil is one of the places most affected by scintillation in the world. For that reason, ionosphere monitoring stations have been deployed over Brazilian territory since 2011 through cooperative projects between several institutions in Europe and Brazil. Such monitoring stations compose a network that generates a large amount of monitoring data everyday. GNSS receivers deployed at these stations – named Ionospheric Scintillation Monitor Receivers (ISMR) – provide scintillation indices and related signal metrics for available satellites dedicated to satellite-based navigation and positioning services. With this monitoring infrastructure, more than ten million observation values are generated and stored every day. Extracting the relevant information from this huge amount of data was a hard process and required the expertise of computer and geoscience scientists. This paper describes the concepts, design and aspects related to the implementation of the software that has been supporting research on ISMR data – the so-called ISMR Query Tool. Usability and other aspects are also presented via examples of application. This web based software has been designed and developed aiming to ensure insights over the huge amount of ISMR data that is fetched every day on an integrated platform. The software applies and adapts time series mining and information visualization techniques to extend the possibilities of exploring and analyzing ISMR data. The software is available to the scientific community through the World Wide Web, therefore constituting an analysis infrastructure that complements the monitoring one, providing support for researching ionospheric scintillation in the GNSS context. Interested researchers can access the functionalities without cost at http://is-cigala-calibra.fct.unesp.br/, under online request to the Space Geodesy Study Group from UNESP – Univ Estadual Paulista at Presidente Prudente."

abstract = {Abstract The numerous recent breakthroughs in machine learning make imperative to carefully ponder how the scientific community can benefit from a technology that, although not necessarily new, is today living its golden age. This Grand Challenge review paper is focused on the present and future role of machine learning in Space Weather. The purpose is twofold. On one hand, we will discuss previous works that use machine learning for Space Weather forecasting, focusing in particular on the few areas that have seen most activity: the forecasting of geomagnetic indices, of relativistic electrons at geosynchronous orbits, of solar flares occurrence, of coronal mass ejection propagation time, and of solar wind speed. On the other hand, this paper serves as a gentle introduction to the field of machine learning tailored to the Space Weather community and as a pointer to a number of open challenges that we believe the community should undertake in the next decade. The recurring themes throughout the review are the need to shift our forecasting paradigm to a probabilistic approach focused on the reliable assessment of uncertainties, and the combination of physics-based and machine learning approaches, known as gray-box.},
